Man, just left the theater and I’m still feeling all kinds of discombobulated. Yo, The Ugly Stepsister — what a ride. Like, you know when you’ve had just way too much to think about and your brain kinda feels like a fizzy soda can? That was me, sitting there. And the popcorn crumbs, they’re sticking to everything, even the air.

There’s this scene, right, where it all just explodes into a rainbow of chaos, like someone smashed a piñata full of paint? Stunning. But then, it gets all introspective, like a cat staring into its reflection wondering if it’s really a tiger. You follow? Nah, maybe I’m just talking wild.

> The guy next to me kept chewing so loudly I nearly lost it. But that’s a   thing, isn’t it? Being distracted by the mundane while the surreal unfurls in front of you. Wouldn’t have it any other way, I guess. My back was not here for those theater seats, though — creaky like old wooden planks.

Remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you want to experience it all over again. Speaking of, I think I left a trail of popcorn behind like Hansel and Gretel but made of soggy kernels. Too much salt, you know?

Scenes where Cinderella and the stepsister face off were like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 two 𝘗𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘰𝘤𝘬s lock horns, if 𝘗𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘰𝘤𝘬s could do that. Just clashing and colorful and kind of mesmerizing. I think someone asked if you could 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   on 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨 later — might wanna check on that. Distracted by the light reflecting off some lady’s giant earrings — disco balls rotating in the theater gloom.

Hope you get to see it — tho, it’s like diving into a swimming pool full of cats and not expecting scratches. You come out different. Changed. Or maybe just a bit more feline than before.

```cpp
int main() {
    int fairyDust = 0;
    while (glassSlippersOn()) {
        fairyDust += sti; // Oh, I've lost track of this code...
        
        /
          + EnchantLevel(details)
          - What was I trying to code again?
         /
    }
    return wandWaving;
}
